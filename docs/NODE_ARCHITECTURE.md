- **Indexing Solution**: The Graph hosted service with failover
- **Oracle Integration**: Chainlink for price feeds and VRF
- **Wallet Integration**: WalletConnect v2 with EIP-1193 support

**Strategic Rationale:**
Polygon's PoS chain provides the ideal balance of Ethereum compatibility, transaction speed, and cost efficiency for a marketplace platform. The multi-chain approach ensures resilience against network-specific issues. Hardhat provides industry-standard development tools while Foundry enhances testing capabilities with its exceptional fuzzing and invariant testing features. The Graph's indexing capabilities are essential for efficient on-chain data retrieval and analytics.
